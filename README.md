Answering
Why you used Arraylist instead of Array.

I use Arraylist for the dynamic resizing, for easy manupilation, to search a value and find position of value.

where you used static members and why.

I use static for the memory efficiency to access it somewhere else and define the class level behaviour.

where you used inheritance and what you gained from it.
